# WireMock API Templates Library

The [library.wiremock.org](https://library.wiremock.org) site provides templates
that can be used with both
[WireMock](https://wiremock.org/) and [WireMock Cloud](https://wiremock.io).

Browse our library of templates and examples for use in mocking APIs,
find the examples that you need,
and get a running mock in seconds&emdash;on your local machine or in the cloud.

## Using templates in WireMock

1. Go to the [Mock API Templates Library](https://library.wiremock.org) site.
2. Choose a template you need. There are categories and search capabilities at your disposal.
3. Click the _Download WireMock JSON_ button to download the JSON file.
4. Use the JSON file to configure your WireMock instance
   See [Using Templates](./usage.md).

## Using templates in WireMock Cloud

<!-- TODO: Replace by the page -->

For WireMock Cloud there is also the _Run in WireMock Cloud_ button that
allows you to quickly import a Mock API definition into your project.

## Editing and Adding templates

Template definitions can be found in another repository:
[wiremock/api-template-library](https://github.com/wiremock/api-template-library).

If you would like to edit the existing template
or to contribute a new Mock API template,
feel free to submit a pull request to
[wiremock/api-template-library](https://github.com/wiremock/api-template-library).
This is a public repository enables WireMock and WireMock Cloud users 
to build their own Mock APIs based off a public template,
e.g. for your public service.

You can add a template to featured list by adding the `featured` tag in the metadata JSON.
If a template is somehow related to WireMock, please also use the `wiremock` tag.

It may take some time to propagate changes to
WireMock or WireMock Cloud.
