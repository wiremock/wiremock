## Python WireMock

**Python WireMock** is a library that allows users to interact with a WireMock instance from within a Python project.
Key features include:

- [Testcontainers Python](./testcontainers.md) module to easily start WireMock server for your tests
- REST API Client for a standalone WireMock Java server
- Support for most of the major WireMock features (more on their way soon)

There is a [Python WireMock Admin API Client](https://github.com/wiremock/python-wiremock)
that connects to a standalone WireMock server.
This project is a part of WireMock's GitHub organization.
