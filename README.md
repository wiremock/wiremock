Questions and Issues
--------------------
If you have a question about WireMock, or are experiencing a problem you're not sure is a bug please post a message to the 
[WireMock mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wiremock-user).

On the other hand if you're pretty certain you've found a bug please open an issue.

Contributing
------------
We welcome bug fixes and new features in the form of pull requests. If you'd like to contribute, please be mindful of the
following guidelines:
* All changes should include suitable tests, whether to demonstrate the bug or exercise and document the new feature.
* Please make one change per pull request.
* If the new feature is significantly large/complex/breaks existing behaviour, please first post a summary of your idea
on the mailing list to generate a discussion. This will avoid significant amounts of coding time spent on changes that ultimately get rejected.
* Try to avoid reformats of files that change the indentation, tabs to spaces etc., as this makes reviewing diffs much
more difficult.
* Abide by [the Architecture Rules](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/tree/master/src/test/java/com/github/tomakehurst/wiremock/archunit) enforced by ArchUnit.

Building WireMock locally
-------------------------
To run all of WireMock's tests:
```bash
./gradlew clean test
```

To build both JARs (thin and standalone):
```bash
./gradlew jar shadowJar 
```

The built JAR will be placed under ``build/libs``.

To publish both JARs to your local Maven repository:

```bash
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```
